# Smart-fridge
The app integrates with a smart refrigerator connected via Ethernet and synced with a fitness app. Equipped with cameras and an internal scale, the fridge helps users automatically track the nutrition values of the food they consume throughout the day. By leveraging real-time data from both the food recognition system and weight measurements, the app provides an accurate calculation of daily nutritional intake.
