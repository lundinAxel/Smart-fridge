The app integrates with a smart refrigerator connected via Wi-Fi and synced with a fitness app. Equipped with cameras and an internal scale, the fridge helps users automatically track the nutritional values of the food they consume throughout the day. By leveraging real-time data from both the food recognition system and weight measurements, the app provides an accurate calculation of daily nutritional intake.

In addition, the app offers personalized user guidance tailored to specific goals, whether itâ€™s maintaining a diet to address nutritional deficiencies, bulking to build muscle, or losing weight. With a focus on individual objectives, users can seamlessly track their progress using detailed charts that display total consumed calories for each day. This allows users to monitor trends, make adjustments to their dietary habits, and update their goals as needed for optimal results.
