## About the App

The app integrates with a smart refrigerator connected via Wi-Fi and synced with a fitness app. Equipped with cameras and an internal scale, the fridge helps users automatically track the nutritional values of the food they consume throughout the day. By leveraging real-time data from both the food recognition system and weight measurements, the app provides an accurate calculation of daily nutritional intake.

### Features
- **Real-time Food Tracking**: Automatically detect and record nutritional values using internal cameras and weight sensors.
- **Personalized Guidance**: Tailored dietary recommendations to help achieve specific goals:
  - Addressing nutritional deficiencies.
  - Bulking to build muscle.
  - Losing weight.
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed charts displaying daily calorie consumption and trends for better decision-making and goal adjustments.
